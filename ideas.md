- add versions to the user cars and also ai responses
- add a button to the forms to generate the analysis
- add the cars page as a card with information => also editing in the advanced mode
- working on the data grid table
- defining a proper range for the fields that we have in the advanced form and others
- adding a new table for the analysis to be filled with usefull information about the car
- in the first stage i will try to ask ai to do most of the heavy lifting, but after a while I will have to just get some properties that i need and then calculate everthing myself, and also maybe as for another car in the same price range and compare them
- fix the issue with the model and year fields that behave weirdly in case we are in a fresh form
- incrementing the version of the user car each time that there is an update operation
- I added a function and trigger to update the last_ai_response_id field of the user_cars to be the latest possible item from ai_responses with the car_id equal to the user_car.id
- to add a new field to the user_cars table to make sure that they are not trying to make multiple saves and rerquests to the ai and we wont get charged mcuh.
- to separate the filling of the user_cars table and the analysis calls, so that by the time that we want to generate the analysis, we already have the user_cars info
- instead of immidiately saving all information that we get from the open ai completion, i should show a message on frontend that would show the values that are recieved and if the usre is fine with them, and if so, then we save them again or they choose to update it.
- find a way to make the AI suggestions more consistent.
