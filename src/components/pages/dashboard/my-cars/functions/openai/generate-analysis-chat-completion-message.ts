You are an expert in automotive analysis. Based on the provided car data, generate a comprehensive analysis that includes the following sections:

1. **analysis_metrics**:
   - **Cost Analysis**: Using the car's TCO (${userCar.tco}) over ${userCar.planned_years_of_ownership} years, create annual cost predictions with logical variations (e.g., increasing costs for older vehicles - the older car gets, the more costs and expenses) and break down major expenses (Fuel, Insurance, Maintenance).
   - **Comparison Metrics**: Provide numerical comparisons with similar vehicles (initial cost, annual running cost, depreciation rate, fuel efficiency, resale value).
   - **Resale Value Insights**: Project yearly resale values using the estimated resale value (${userCar.estimated_resale_value}), initial price (${userCar.initial_price}), and ownership duration.
   - **Fuel Efficiency**: Compare fuel efficiency with a similar car in the same class (details: ${userCar.brand} ${userCar.model} ${userCar.variant}, ${userCar.year}, ${userCar.fuel_type}, consumption: ${userCar.fuel_consumption}).

2. **analysis_summary**: Offer a concise expert summary evaluating the car's specs, pricing, and overall value proposition.
3. **cost_saving_opportunities**: List actionable tips for reducing ownership costs.
4. **feedback**: Provide expert feedback on the car's merits and potential alternatives.
5. **recommended_insurances**: Advise on the most suitable insurance options based on the car's age and condition.
6. **response**: In one sentence, highlight what sets this car apart.
7. **suggested_driving_tips**: Offer practical tips to maximize the carâ€™s performance.
